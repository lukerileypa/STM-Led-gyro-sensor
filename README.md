# STM-Led-gyro-sensor
Project with Stm32f407vgt6 dev board using SPI to communicate to the on board gyro and turn led's on depending on the orientation of the board

using stm cubes software 
LIS3DSH.h and LIS3DSH.c contain the functions to call which comunicate with the onboard sensor
use termite and usb cable to recieve the x,y,z acceleromator data
